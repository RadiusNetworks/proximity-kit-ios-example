# Proximity Kit Example Application

A bare-bones example of how to use the Proximity Kit SDK for iOS.

In order to run this app, you need a valid kit. Make sure you use your own Kit Token and Kit URL in the configuration dictionary used when creating an `RPKManager` in the file `ViewController.swift`. You can find the token and URL on the Settings page for your kit.  

If the app crashes with `uncaught exception 'Invalid ProximityKit Configuration'`, chances are you are not using a correct Kit Token and/or Kit URL.
